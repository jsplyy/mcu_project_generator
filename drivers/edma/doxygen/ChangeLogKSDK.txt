@section eDMA EDMA
  Current EDMA driver version is 2.1.1
  
  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
  - 2.0.1
    - Bug fix:
      - Fix the eDMA callback does not check valid status issue in EDMA_HandleIRQ API.
  - 2.0.2
    - Bug fix:
      - Fix incorrect minorLoopBytes type definition in _edma_transfer_config struct. Define minorLoopBytes as uint32_t instead of uint16_t.
  - 2.0.3
    - Bug fix:
      - Fix the wrong pubweak IRQHandler name issue which will cause re-definition build errors when client sets his/her own IRQHandler,
        by changing the 32-channel IRQHandler name to DriverIRQHandler.
  - 2.0.4
    - Improvement:
      - Add support for SoCs with multiple eDMA instances.
      - Add pubweak DriverIRQHandler for KL28T DMA1 and MCIMX7U5_M4.

      - Add pubweak DriverIRQHandler for K32H844P (16 channels shared).
  - 2.1.0
    - Improvement:
      - Change the EDMA_GetRemainingBytes API into EDMA_GetRemainingMajorLoopCount, due to eDMA IP limitation (refer to the API comments/note for further details).
  - 2.1.1
    - Improvement:
      - Add documentation of the eDMA data flow when scatter/gather is implemented for the EDMA_HandleIRQ API.
      - Update and correct some related comments in the EDMA_HandleIRQ API and edma_handle_t struct.
