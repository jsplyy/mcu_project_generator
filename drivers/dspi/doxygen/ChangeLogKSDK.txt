  - 2.1.2
    - Bug Fix:
      - DSPI_MasterTransferBlocking function would hang in some corner cases. (for example, some cases with bitsPerFrame is 4,6 and kDSPI_MasterPcsContinuous transfer mode)

    - Bug Fix:
      - DSPI EDMA driver can no longer support the case that the transfer data size is odd but the bitsPerFrame is greater than 8.

  - 2.1.4
