@section uart UART
  Current UART driver version is 2.1.4

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.

  - 2.1.0
    - Add transactional API.

  - 2.1.1
    - Remove needless check of event flags and assert in UART_RTOS_Receive.
    - Wait always for rx event flag in UART_RTOS_Receive.

  - 2.1.2
    - Fix baud rate fine adjust bug to make the computed baud rate more accurately.

  - 2.1.3
    - Add rx framing error and parity error status check when use interrupt transfer.

  - 2.1.4
    - Change parameter type in UART_RTOS_Init() struct rtos_uart_config --> uart_rtos_config_t.
    - Bug fixed:
      - Disable UART receive interrupt instead of disable all NVIC when read data from ring buffer. 
        Because with ring buffer used, receive nonblocking will disable all NVIC interrupts to protect 
        the ring buffer, this will have negative effect to other IPS which are using interrupt.
