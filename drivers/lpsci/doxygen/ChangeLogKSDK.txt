@section lpsci LPSCI
  Current LPSCI driver version is 2.0.3

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.

  - 2.0.1
    - Update baudrate code. Before setting baudrate, first check whether the
      value is valid or not, if not valid, don't change baudrate and return.
    - Remove needless check of event flags and assert in LPSCI_RTOS_Receive.
    - Wait always for rx event flag in LPSCI_RTOS_Receive.

  - 2.0.2
    - Add rx framing error and parity error status check when use interrupt transfer.

  - 2.0.3
    - Change parameter type in LPSCI_RTOS_Init() struct rtos_lpsci_config --> lpsci_rtos_config_t.
    - Bug fixed:
      - Disable LPSCI receive interrupt instead of disable all NVIC when read data from ring buffer. 
        Because with ring buffer used, receive nonblocking will disable all NVIC interrupts to protect 
        the ring buffer, this will have negative effect to other IPS which are using interrupt.
