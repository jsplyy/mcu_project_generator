@section i2c I2C
  Current I2C driver version is 2.0.3
  

  - 2.0.1
    - New Features:
      - Add double buffer enable configuration for Socs which have the DFEN bit in S2 register
      - Add flexible transmit/receive buffer size support in I2C_SlaveHandleIRQ
      - Add start flag clear, address match and release bus operation in I2C_SlaveWrite/ReadBlocking API
    - Bug Fix:
      - change the kI2C_SlaveRepeatedStartEvent to kI2C_SlaveStartEvent
  - 2.0.2
    - Bug Fix:
      - Fix the issue that in master receive and slave transmit mode with no stop flag, master could not 
        succeed to start next transfer because master could not send out re-start signal
      - Fix data transfer out of order issue due to memory barrier
      - Add hold time configuration for slave. By leaving the SCL divider and MULT reset values when configure to slave mode, 
       the setup and hold time of the slave is then reduced outside of spec for lower baudrates. This can cause intermittent 
       arbitration loss on the master side.
    - New Features:
      - Add address nak event for master.
      - Add general call event for slave.
  - 2.0.3
    - Bug Fix:
      - Remove enableHighDrive member in the master/slave configuration structure because the operation to HDRS bit is useless,
        user needs to use DSE bit in port register to configure the high drive capability.
